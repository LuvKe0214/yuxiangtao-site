## Short Bio
Hi，I'm Yuxiang (Elias). I'm a first year Computer Science student at OSU. I'm interested in AI, data analysis, and building high tech tools that solve real-world problems.
I enjoy work where you can’t “fake it”，the data is imperfect, the system is complex, and progress comes from testing, iterating, and staying honest about what holds up. I value teamwork and service, and I try to show up consistently whether that’s in a lab, a project team, or community work. Long term, I want to build technology that helps people live better, with the hope of contributing, however small to a more peaceful and caring world.

## Focus Areas
- Research: Microbiome modeling & simulation · ML for dynamical systems · LLM applications
- Making: Data pipelines & modeling tools(PyTorch)· small full-stack builds · reproducible demos
- Works: · Food drive volunteering · Community outreach · Peer tutoring · Cooking ·  Marketing and Operations · Student org contributions (events, coordination)

## What I'm Looking For 
I’m looking for an environment with strong mentorship and hands on projects, where I can keep building, testing, and learning


## Fun Facts
- I’m happiest when I’m cooking something new and sharing it with family.
- I like trying to make complicated things simpler or make simpler things complicated
- Most of peole's childhoods' dream is to being a Scientist, which includes me!
- I always show up early!!!
