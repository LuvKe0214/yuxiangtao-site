## Topics
- [Research Topic / Experience 1](/research/topic-1/)
- [Research Topic / Experience 2](/research/topic-2/)

## Interests
- Microbial Dynamics:Utilizing cNODE (Compositional Neural Ordinary Differential Equation) to predict temporal composition and species interactions.
- Deep Learning Architecture: Comparing different models and test them out to simulate the data for microbiome forecasting.
- White-box LLMs: Investigating internal mechanisms of Large Language Models to move beyond black-box architectures and hallucination Detection

## GOAL
The primary goal is to bridge the gap between complex microbial ecology and deep learning by developing models that are not only predictive but also mechanically interpretable.
