## Overview
Built at an OSU hackathon, Daily Pulse aggregates news across categories like tech, politics, world affairs, and entertainment, then formats each topic into a quick three-bullets recap. The focus was on readability and consistency which more like a daily briefing than a chat interface.

## What I did
**Summary rules & prompt design:** Defined a “news editor” instruction set to keep tone neutral and output consistent in a three-bullet format.  
- **The day on the history:** small fun part about the day of history 
- **Multi-category pipeline:** Set up an automated pipeline that pulls and organizes stories by category


## Outcome
Won Most Creative Award (AI Studio section) at the OSU Hackathon (Oct 2025).  
This is the first project i used AI to build, link to the API is like built a small agent
